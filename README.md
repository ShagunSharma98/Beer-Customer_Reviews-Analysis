# Beer-Review-Analysis


Consumer feedback contains a wealth of information and insights about product features, perception of the benefits they provide and how well brands perform on these features but often this analysis of consumer feedback is done through traditional approaches like Market Research which is time and cost intensive and do not capture the scale at which the information is available.

This repository is an attempt to create a “Brand Intelligence solution” to enter into craft beer market by gaining deeper understanding of the customer to inform strategic priorities by leveraging AI and NLP that analyses consumer feedback captured in the form of product reviews (from e-commerce platform) in fast and efficient manner (days instead of months) to identify customers unmet needs and prioritize these for your client to focus as they enter this crowded market. 


As a starting point we are provided with a dataset of ~9,000 reviews here from online stores, which consists of details like the brand and product names, the customer review (as free text) made against that product, rating given to that review and the date on which that review is put up. We are also provided with a very sample taxonomy to get started, which should help us come up with strategies to label/annotate the categories as the raw data we provide do not contain any labeled data that we can use to create ML/DL models.
